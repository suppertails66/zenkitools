This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English

                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC.

Get a ROM image of the original game, which should have an MD5 sum of
ac6ed281ac8e9d71af186602951cfd7a. Rename it "zenki.gg" and place it in the
"zenki" folder. Then:

$ cd zenki
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as zenki_en.gg.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.
